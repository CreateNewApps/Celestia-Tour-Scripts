Celestia-Tour-Scripts
=====================
###*Some Cel-Scripts for Celestia, providing a Tour to some intressting Places within our Universe.*###

*The provided Scripts here are meant to be used with Celestia ([available here](http://www.shatters.net/celestia/download.html)) and because I use the older CEL-Scripting, instead of CELX, this Scripts should be run on nearly every Celestia Release out there in the field.*


_**WARNING:**_
These Scripts are highly depending on my local Celestia-Configuration, so you might be getting diffrent Results. I will try to remove these parts before a Release will be publised, but I am a human, and humans do mistakes... ;-)

So this Repo is actual in **_ALPHA-State_**. So there is no guarantee of working. And even CEL-Scripts couldn't harm your System, use the files here on your own Risk.

For Information about Celestia visit:

or

In Future, i hope to provide my Scripts to easily alter your Celestia-Configuration without harming it.

Feel free to leave a comment.

For each Tour-Script i will publish the resulting Video for those who don't want to install Celestia...

Have Fun!
